# hi, I’m Dellk

Student interested in how systems work under the hood.
I tend to favor simple, minimal and predictable setups. When something breaks, I usually try to understand why before patching over it.
Currently focused on Linux-based environments, lightweight automation, and small experiments that deliberately run under constraints.

## what I (usually) work with
- Linux (daily use, minimal setups)
- Shell / Bash
- Python (scripts, automation, small tools)
- Git
- Modified Android / Termux
- Headless systems and lightweight services

## about my projects
Most repositories here are either utilities or experiments.
Not everything is meant to scale or become a product. Some exist just to test an idea or solve a specific annoyance.
If something looks odd, it was likely intentional.

## my approach
- fewer dependencies, fewer problems
- clarity over cleverness
- simple documentation beats “*smart*” code
- breaking things is fine, not learning from it isn’t

### outside GitHub
Language learning, old hardware, system internals, and music.

### important note about myself
I use the name Dellk as an online handle to preserve privacy and keep a clear separation between my personal life and my work shared here.
